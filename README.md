# Hosptal_Analysis
In this project, I utilized Power BI to analyze patient information at Popolo Hospital, focusing on key areas such as patient categorization, billing details, doctor feedback, bed occupancy, and billing versus insurance amounts. Leveraging slicers and diverse chart types, the analysis provided dynamic visual insights for informed decision-making.
